"# GenreClassification#"

This Project deals with classifying the movies based on their genre in the dataset. This dataset is formed by scraping the IMDB and TMDB dataset. The dataset used for the project is stored in the csv file.

Since the dataset contains mostly categorical attributes it was difficult to classify the dataset.
